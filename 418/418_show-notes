# Episode 418 Show Notes: S-Tier Face (Merlin Mann Part 1)

This is the first of two episodes. The idea was for Merlin and Jeff to discuss how they were using chatGPT in ways that are maybe novel. The thing is, the pre-show banter became in-show banter that barely touched the intended topic, which is awesome because now, thanks to the transcript of this episode, we have fodder for chatGPT experimentation between episodes.

With that, we present to you these show notes:

- [Overtired #402: Emotional Sweep with Merlin Mann](https://overtiredpod.com/ep/402/) is a pretty good introduction to the chatGPT conversation we'll have in the second part of this two-episode set.
- This episode has a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Cl97UPpTl2CiIFYuWFiyZ?si=5c982c2333254262)!
