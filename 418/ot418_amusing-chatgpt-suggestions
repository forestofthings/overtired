# Amusing chatGPT Suggestions

I asked chatGPT to generate a Markdown checklist of suspected transcription errors. Some were very amusing.

- [ ] **Incorrect Album Reference**: "**Vampire on Titus**" is an **album**, not an EP, by Guided by Voices.
- [ ] **Mistranscribed Phrase**: "I was **riding my own mustache**." This seems incorrect; possibly misheard.
- [ ] **Mistranscribed Term**: "**Carass**" should be "**karass**," a term from Kurt Vonnegut's works.
- [ ] **Mistranscribed Term**: "**Threphining**" should be "**trepanning**" or "**trephining**," referring to drilling into the skull.
- [ ] **Mistranscribed Phrase**: "I like to **cut up your jib**" should be "I like the **cut of your jib**."
- [ ] **Mistranscribed Phrase**: "Stop **licking my hat**." Possibly misheard; could be "Stop **looking at** my hat."
- [ ] **Mistranscribed Phrase**: "The engine died in the **museum**" likely should be "The engine died in the **median**."
- [ ] **Huey Lewis Sports** → Should be **"Huey Lewis and the News' Sports"**.
- [ ] **Meathead label** → Likely referring to **Amphetamine Reptile Records**; check for correctness.
